# BASIC

A simple implementation of the BASIC programming language in Python

## Interpreter

Type `RUN` to run the program.

Type `LIST` to list all of the lines of a program.

Each line should start with a line number, lines executed from lowest to highest line number.

Ex.
```
10 PRINT First line!
30 PRINT Third line!
20 PRINT Second line!
40 END

RUN
First line!
Second line!
Third line!
```

To print, use the `PRINT` keyword and what to print afterwards.

Ex.
```
10 PRINT Hello world!
20 END

RUN
Hello world!
```

To end a program, use the `END` keyword

Ex.
```
10 PRINT Hello!
20 END
30 PRINT This will not print.

RUN
Hello!
```
